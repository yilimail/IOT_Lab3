Description:
In this lab, we will build an infrastructure management for IoT devices. We leverage GNS3 to run real router images on the local computer. We will design and create a large IoT infrastructure for large retailers, and simulate deploying a large number of sensors to track and monitor goods in the store, as well as gaze tracking to monitor shopper behavior and collect datasets to analyze how the product placement is doing. We will deploy a set of access points to communicate with your IoT devices and develop infrastructure to store this data locally in a data warehouse.


To get the code work:

put Projects folder under GNS3 folder
Open file test project file by GNS3
